What Works:
    * The letters tiles are selected randomly from a data structure,
      which keeps track of the distribution of the letters
    * Can drag and drop letter from the rack and board and vice-versa
    * The board will give bonus points if the letter is on the those 
      tiles
    * A user can submit any word that is two letters or more
    * The user can start the game over meaning the distribution of
      letters goes back to the start and all scores restart
    * A Total Score is kept for all word submitted
    * New tiles are added to the rack after the submit button is pressed
      to bring it up to 7 letters again.
    
What Does Not Work/Not Implemented:
    * I could not get it to reject the tile if it placed on another tile.
      I did get it the reject the tile, but when the tile gets removed,
      it would not remove it from the word and keep it part of the word,
      in my internal data structures
    * I did not implement a dictionary into the submit button, so it 
      currently accepts any combination of the letters greater than 
      a length of 2
    * Only one row of tiles
