            <p> I am currently a Senior Undergradute Computer Science with a minor in Robotics student
                at UMass Lowell. I am planning on continuing my studies by enrolling in the BS/MS Program. </p>
            <p> I am also working on a Honors Project this year in which I will be building a robot to play a game. 
                The game is played on a 12' x 12' field with two alliance of two teams, meaning there are 
                four robots playing at once. The objective of the game is create stack cubes into the corners of the
                field. </p>
            <p> I am from Framingham, Massachusetts. I graduated from Framingham High School in 2017. 
                During high school, I was the captain of one of the robotics team, which pushed 
                and encouraged me to do my honors project on robotics.</p>
            <p> Some of my interest include playing and watching sports, like Spikeball, Football, Ultimate Frisbee. 
                Other interest include playing cards, spending time with friends and solving puzzles. </p>
